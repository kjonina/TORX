### Tor Des Géants | TOR330 - The Obsession

I found out about Tor Des Géants in 2018. Of course, like everyone who ever head of TOR330, I was mesmarised by the whole race. 

In 2023, I was fortunate enough to make it back in one piece to Courmayeur, crossing the finish line with four French men, who metaphorically dragged me up Col Malatra (last climb) with their enthuasism and 'WAZUH' screams!

In 2025, I am in for the lottery, chasing that euphoric feeling of the finish that is very hard to replicate. 

As many different athelete patiently wait for the lottery to be concluded, I decided to use my data science knowledge to some good, and answers some of the burning questions and myths about the race.


### Tor Des Géants | TOR330 - The Myths

As I was preparing for TOR330, I heard a lot of folktales and myths.

- Stage 4 takes longer than 24 hours but cut off time betweeen Donnas and Gressoney is only 21 hours. 
- As a result, a lot of people miss Gressoney cut-off.
- At least 4 extra hours need to banked before Donnas to get to Gressoney before the cut off.
- If you get to Gressoney in half-decent shape, it is highly likely you will finish the race. 
- Many people run the first half too fast and don't leave anything in the tank for the second half of the race.
